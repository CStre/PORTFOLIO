# Professional Portfolio

## Project Overview

<strong>This repository is the backbone of a major full-stack web development project, crafted specifically to be the highlight of my resume portfolio. It uses the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) to showcase a wide range of abilities and experiences in web development. The project not only demonstrates skills in building and managing websites but also covers a variety of Computer Science fundamentals, from basic systems design to complex algorithms. This diverse expertise reflects a well-rounded understanding of the digital world, making this portfolio a true representation of my professional journey in web development and computer science.

</p>
<p align="center">
MongoDB is a powerful NoSQL database that allows for flexible and scalable data storage. Its document-oriented data model makes it ideal for handling complex, unstructured data commonly encountered in web applications. MongoDB's features include high availability, horizontal scaling, and a rich query language, providing developers with the tools needed to build robust backend systems.
</p>

### Express.js
<p align="center">
  <img src="./logos/Express_logo.png" alt="Express.js Logo" width="200"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs. With Express.js, developers can easily create server-side applications, define routes, handle middleware, and manage HTTP requests and responses. Its simplicity and extensibility make it a popular choice for building RESTful APIs and web servers.
</p>

### Angular
<p align="center">
  <img src="./logos/Angular_logo.png" alt="Angular Logo" width="200"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
Angular is a powerful front-end framework developed and maintained by Google. It simplifies the development of dynamic, single-page web applications by providing a comprehensive toolkit for building reusable components, managing state, and handling user interactions. Angular's features include two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a modular architecture, enabling developers to create scalable and maintainable applications with ease.
</p>

### Node.js
<p align="center">
  <img src="./logos/Node.js_logo.png" alt="Node.js Logo" width="200"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it suitable for building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js comes with a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it a popular choice for building backend services, APIs, and real-time applications.
